# Description
There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

 
# Constraints
* 2 <= n <= 10^5
* n - 1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
* 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
* ai != bi
* There are no repeated connections.

# Example
**Input**: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]



**Output**: [[1,3]]

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
Find all the bridges in the graph. We should use trajan's algorithm. Record the visiting time and low(the lowest visiting time in this connect component). Pay attention to how they update and how to detect the bridges.

# Key word
DFS

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
    
public:
    vector<int>dfn,low;
    int time = 1;
    vector<vector<int>>res;
    unordered_map<int,vector<int>>m;
    vector<vector<int>> criticalConnections(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        dfn.resize(n);
        low.resize(n);
        for(auto c:connections){
            m[c[0]].push_back(c[1]);
            m[c[1]].push_back(c[0]);
        }
        dfs(0,-1);
        return res;
    }
    void dfs(int curr, int prev){
        dfn[curr] = low[curr] = time++;
        for(int next: m[curr]){
           if(next == prev) {
                continue;
            }
            if(dfn[next]==0){
                dfs(next, curr);
                low[curr] = min(low[curr], low[next]);
                if(low[next] > dfn[curr]) {
                    res.push_back({curr, next});
                }
            }
            else
                low[curr] = min(low[curr], dfn[next]);
        }
    }
};
