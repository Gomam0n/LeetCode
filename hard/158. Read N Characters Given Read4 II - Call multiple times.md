# Description
Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.

# Constraints

* 1 <= file.length <= 500
* file consist of English letters and digits.
* 1 <= queries.length <= 10
* 1 <= queries[i] <= 500

# Example
**Input**: file = "abc", queries = [1,2,1]


**Output**: [1,2,0]

**Explanation**:  The test case represents the following scenario:
File file("abc");  
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "a". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.  
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.  
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.


# Solution
Considering the difference between this problem with [157. Read N Characters Given Read4](../easy/157.%20Read%20N%20Characters%20Given%20Read4.md).In 157, some of the character will be discarded when n is less than the length of file and n can not be divided by 4. In this problem we can not discard them so that we need an extra place to store the 4 characters that we read and put enough chars to the buf.

    int idx = 0;
    int count = 0;
    int read(char *buf, int n) {
        int i = 0;
        while(i<n){
            if(idx==0)
                count = read4(store);
            if(count==0)
                break;
            // here we can also delete the while loop, but it may run slower
            while(i<n&&idx<count)
                buf[i++] = store[idx++];
            if(idx==count)
                idx = 0;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
