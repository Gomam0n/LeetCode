# Description
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

# Constraints
* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 5000
* -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
* nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.


# Example
**Input**: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]


**Output**: 0

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
Compared to [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](../medium/153.%20Find%20Minimum%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array.md), we do not know what the new range should be when mid equals right. So in that case we just move right to left by 1, this operation is safe because it will not remove the min out as mid equals right.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int l = 0,r = n-1;
        int mid;
        while(l<r){
            mid = (l+r)/2;
            if(nums[r]<nums[mid]){
                l = mid+1;
            }else if(nums[r]>nums[mid]){
                r = mid;
            }else
                r--;
                
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
};
