# Description
This is an interactive problem.

You are given an array of unique strings wordlist where wordlist[i] is 6 letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as secret.

You may call Master.guess(word) to guess a word. The guessed word should have type string and must be from the original list with 6 lowercase letters.

This function returns an integer type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return -1 instead.

For each test case, you have exactly 10 guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made 10 or fewer calls to Master.guess and at least one of these guesses was secret, then you pass the test case.

# Constraints
* 1 <= wordlist.length <= 100
* wordlist[i].length == 6
* wordlist[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
* All the strings of wordlist are unique.
* secret exists in wordlist.
* numguesses == 10


# Example
**Input**:  secret = "acckzz", wordlist = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"], numguesses = 10



**Output**: You guessed the secret word correctly.

**Explanation**: master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.  
master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.  
master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.  
master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.  
master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.  
We made 5 calls to master.guess and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.  

 
# Solution
The problem has a tricky description. Actually we can not gurantee to find the word in 10 guesses. But we must find the most efficient way to find the word. We can exclude some words if we guess one and get the results. We should make sure we can exclude the most words with any return values.

 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation

public:
    int count (string s1, string s2){
        int n = s1.size();  // The inputs should ensure s1 and s2 have the same size
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            if(s1[i]==s2[i])
                res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
    // Find the string in the list that can give us the most information
    string find(vector<string>&wordlist){
        int n = wordlist.size();
        vector<vector<int>>next(n,vector<int>(7,0));

                int cnt = count(wordlist[i],wordlist[j]);
                next[i][cnt]++;
                next[j][cnt]++;

                currMax = max(currMax,next[i][j]);
            }
            if(currMax<minNext){
                minNext = currMax;
                idx = i;
            }
        }
        return wordlist[idx];
    }

    void findSecretWord(vector<string>& wordlist, Master& master) {
        for(int i = 0;i<10;i++){
            if(wordlist.size()==0)
                break;
            string str = find(wordlist);
            int res = master.guess(str);
            vector<string>next;
            for(string s:wordlist){
                if(count(s,str)==res)
                    next.push_back(s);
            }
            wordlist = next;

        }
    }
