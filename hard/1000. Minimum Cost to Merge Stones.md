# Description
There are n piles of stones arranged in a row. The ith pile has stones[i] stones.

A move consists of merging exactly k consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these k piles.

Return the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return -1.

# Constraints
* n == stones.length
* 1 <= n <= 30
* 1 <= stones[i] <= 100
* 2 <= k <= 30

# Example
**Input**: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 2


**Output**: 20

**Explanation**: We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].  
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].  
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].  
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].  
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

public:
    int mergeStones(vector<int>& stones, int k) {
        int n = stones.size();
        if((n-1)%(k-1)!=0)
            return -1;

        vector<int>presum(n+1,0);
        // calculate the prefix sum
        for(int i = 1;i<=n;i++)
            presum[i] = presum[i-1]+stones[i-1];
        
        
        vector<vector<int>>dp(n,vector<int>(n,0));
        // the dp array contains the sum of all the stones, which will be easier when transfer 
        // when returning the result, we should minus the sum

        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            dp[i][i] = stones[i];
        }
        // the outer loop can also use j
        for(int len = 2;len<=n;len++){
            for(int i = 0;i<n-len+1;i++){
                int j = i+len-1;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][i]+dp[i+1][j];

                for(int s = i+k-1;s<j;s+=k-1){
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j],dp[i][s]+dp[s+1][j]);
                }
                // if we can convert the range into one stone, we will add an addtional cost, which is the sum of the range
                // so that we can use the new stone for further computation
                if((j-i)%(k-1)==0){
                    dp[i][j]+=presum[j+1]-presum[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n-1]-presum[n];

    }
