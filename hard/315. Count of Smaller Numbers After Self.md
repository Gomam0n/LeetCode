# Description
You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

# Constraints
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

# Example
**Input**: nums = [5,2,6,1]


**Output**: [2,1,1,0]

**Explanation**: 
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

# Solution
This problem is very similar to find the reverse pairs in an array. So we can use merge sort to solve it. Pay attention to store the original position of each elements and change them in each merge.  
Another way to solve it is to use binary indexed tree. It is a data structure similar to segment tree. It is used to calculate the prefix sum and range sum of an array efficiently. In this problem, we need to first discrete the elements, which means turning them into consective numbers according to their amounts.

Binary Indexed Tree, Merge Sort

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class BIT {
private:
    vector<int> tree;
    int n;

public:
    BIT(int _n): n(_n), tree(_n + 1) {}

    static int lowbit(int x) {
        return x & (-x);
    }

    int query(int x) {
        int ret = 0;
        while (x) {
            ret += tree[x];
            x -= lowbit(x);
        }
        return ret;
    }

    void update(int x, int delta) {
        while (x <= n) {
            tree[x] += delta;
            x += lowbit(x);
        }
    }
};
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countSmaller(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int>dis = nums,res;
        sort(dis.begin(),dis.end());
        for(int &n: nums){
            n = lower_bound(dis.begin(),dis.end(),n)-dis.begin()+1; // if do not plus one, update and query function may not terminate
        }
        BIT tree(n+1);
        for(int i = n-1;i>=0;i--){
            tree.update(nums[i], 1);
            res.push_back(tree.query(nums[i]-1));
        }
        reverse(res.begin(),res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
