# Description
Given an m x n boardÂ of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

# Constraints
* m == board.length
* n == board[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 12
* board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
* words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
* All the strings of words are unique.


# Example
**Input**: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]



**Output**: ["eat","oath"]

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
Use dfs to search possible words beginning from all the grids. Use trie to store all the words in advance to avoid traverse the word lists.  
**Pay attention to the case that there are several ways to construct one word. In order to deal with them, I remove the word after it is added into the result vector.**

# Key word
Trie, Dfs, Bfs

# Code

## cpp
```cpp

class Trie {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    vector<Trie*>next;
    string word = "";
    Trie(){
        next = vector<Trie*>(26,nullptr);
    }
    
    /** Inserts a word into the trie. */
    Trie* insert(string word) {
        Trie* curr = this;
        for(char c: word){
            if(curr->next[c-'a']==nullptr){
                curr->next[c-'a'] = new Trie;
            }
            curr = curr->next[c-'a'];
        }
        curr->word = word;
        return curr;
    }
};
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string>res;
    vector<string> findWords(vector<vector<char>>& board, vector<string>& words) {
        Trie *t = new Trie();
        for(string s:words){
            t->insert(s);
        }
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        for(int i = 0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j = 0;j<n;j++){
                dfs(board,i,j,t);
            }
        }
        return res;

    }
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board ,int i, int j, Trie * t){
        
        if(i<0||i>=board.size()||j<0||j>=board[0].size()||board[i][j]=='*')
            return;
        t = t->next[board[i][j]-'a'];
        if(t==nullptr)
            return ;
        if(t->word!="")
        {
            
            res.push_back(t->word);
            t->word = "";
        }
        char c = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '*';
        dfs(board,i+1,j,t);
        dfs(board,i-1,j,t);
        dfs(board,i,j+1,t);
        dfs(board,i,j-1,t);
        board[i][j] = c;

    }
};

```
time: O(M(4*3^(L-1))), M is the number of grids, L is the length of longest word.

space: O(N), N is the number of letters in the trie.
