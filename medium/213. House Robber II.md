# Description
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, andÂ it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.


# Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# Example
**Input**: nums = [2,3,2]


**Output**: 3

**Explanation**: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.


# Solution
We can reduce this problem to [198. House Robber](198.%20House%20Robber.md) by removing the first element and then removing the last element. The answer should be the larger one because it covers all the cases.

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size()==1)
            return nums[0];
        vector<int>noFirst(nums.begin()+1,nums.end()),noLast(nums.begin(),nums.end()-1);
        return max(help(noFirst),help(noLast));
        
    }
    int help(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int>dp(n,0);
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        if(n==1)
            return dp[0];
        dp[1] = max(nums[0],nums[1]);
        for(int i = 2;i<n;i++){
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1],nums[i]+dp[i-2]);
        }
        return dp[n-1];
    }

};
