# Description
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs inÂ O(log n) time.

# Constraints
* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 5000
* -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
* All the integers of nums are unique.
* nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.


# Example
**Input**: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]


**Output**: 1

**Explanation**: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

# Solution
Very similar to [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](33.%20Search%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array.md) but even more simple.   
Compare left and mid: 1. left is larger than mid, then the right side is in order and the min is in [left, mid] 2. left is smaller or equal than mid, then the left side is in order, the min is in the right side **or it is left**.  
Compare right and mid: 1. right is larger or equal mid, then the min is in left side. 2. Otherwise the min is in right side. **Pay atttention to the equal**
