# Description
You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

* Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

# Constraints
* n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
* 2 <= n <= 250
* -10^5 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5


# Example
**Input**: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]


**Output**: 16

**Explanation**: We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:
- Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.


# Solution
Not difficult but trickt problem. We can always change the sign of two elements wherever they are. If there are odd number of negative elements, we should leave the element with least absolute value(may be positive at first) to be negative. Pay attention to the case of 0. Also we should use long instead of int.

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxMatrixSum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int remain = INT_MAX;
        int cnt = 0;
        long long res = 0;
        int m = matrix.size(),n = matrix[0].size();
        for(int i = 0;i<m;i++)
            for(int j = 0;j<n;j++){
                if(matrix[i][j]<=0)
                    cnt++;
                if(abs(remain)>abs(matrix[i][j]))
                    remain = abs(matrix[i][j]);
                res+=abs(matrix[i][j]);
            }
        if(cnt%2==1)
            return res-2*remain;
        else
            return res;
    }
};
