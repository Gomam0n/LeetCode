# Description
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).

# Constraints
* n == graph.length
* 2 <= n <= 15
* 0 <= graph[i][j] < n
* graph[i][j] != i (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
* All the elements of graph[i] are unique.
* The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.


# Example
**Input**: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]


**Output**: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
Use dfs from the beginning node to search for the path. As it is a DAG, we do not need a *visited* vector to denote the visited nodes.

# Key word
Dfs, Bfs

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    //unordered_set<int>visited;
    vector<vector<int>>res;
    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<int>path{0};
        dfs(graph,0,path);
        return res;
    }
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int curr, vector<int>&path){
        if(curr==graph.size()-1)
            res.push_back(path);
        else{
            for(auto n:graph[curr]){
                path.push_back(n);
                dfs(graph,n,path);
                path.pop_back();
            }
        }
    }
};

```
time: O(n*2<sup>n</sup>), notice the constraint of n, the time complexity is tricky, every node have two status, chosen or not chosen and we need O(n) to copy and store the path.


space: O(n), the return vector should not be counted
