# Description
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
# Constraints
* 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
* -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
* All values of nums are unique.
* nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
* -10^4 <= target <= 10^4


# Example
**Input**: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0


**Output**: 4

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
If we divide the array into two parts, at least one part is in order. So we should first determine which part is in order and then compare the target with the first and last elements in this part to see if it is in the range. So we can do the binary search.

Binary Search

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int l = 0,r = n-1;
        while(l<=r){
            int mid = (l+r)/2;
            if(nums[mid]==target)
                return mid;
            // if the left part is in order
            if(nums[l]<=nums[mid]){
                // if targe is between nums[l] and nums[mid] we narrow the range to l-mid
                if(nums[l]<=target&&target<nums[mid])
                    r = mid-1;
                else
                    l = mid+1;
            }else{
            // otherwise the right part must be in order
                if(nums[mid]<target&&target<=nums[r])
                    l = mid+1;
                else
                    r = mid-1;
            }

        }
        return -1;
    }
};

```
