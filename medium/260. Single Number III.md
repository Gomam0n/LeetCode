# Description
Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

# Constraints
* 2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
* -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
* Each integer in nums will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.


# Example
**Input**: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]


**Output**: [3,5]

**Explanation**: [5, 3] is also a valid answer. 

# Solution
If we xor all the elements, the result will be the xor of the two answers. Then we divide the array according to the difference in bit level of the two answers and xor them separately. We should know that a^a = 0.

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int x = 0;;
        for(int i:nums)
            x^=i;
        int p = 0;
        while(true){
            if((x&(1<<p))!=0)
                break;
            p++;
        }
        int zero = 0, one = 0;
        for(int i : nums){
            if((i&(1<<p))!=0)
                one^=i;
            else
                zero^=i;
        }
        return {one,zero};
    }
};
