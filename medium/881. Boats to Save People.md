# Description
You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.
# Constraints
* 1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4
* 1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10^4

# Example
**Input**: people = [1,2], limit = 3


**Output**: 1

**Explanation**: 1 boat (1, 2)

# Solution
Try to pair the heaviest person with the lightest person. If can not pair, pair the second heaviest person... Use two pointer to point the current heavy person and light person. Sort the array and traverse from the end to the beginning until the two pointers meet.

# Key word
Greedy, Two Pointers

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        sort(people.begin(),people.end());
        int n = people.size(), res = 0;
        vector<bool>on(n,false);
        int r = n-1;
        int l = 0;
        while(l<=r){
            if(people[l]+people[r]<=limit)
                l++;
            r--;
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

```
