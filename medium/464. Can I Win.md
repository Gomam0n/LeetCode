# Description
In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.

# Constraints
* 1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20
* 0 <= desiredTotal <= 300

# Example
**Input**: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11


**Output**: false

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
As the maxChoosableInteger is small, we can use bit mask. Use a variable to represent the choosing state of all the integers. Do dfs to find if one can win from the current state. In the dfs function, we do not care about who is taking this turn. But if the other person can not win in **one of**the next state, the person will win. We can start with state 0 and we only care about the result of state 0.

## cpp
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    bool canIWin(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal) {
        vector<int>dp((1<<maxChoosableInteger), 0);
        if(maxChoosableInteger*(maxChoosableInteger+1)/2 <desiredTotal) // this will not be considered in dfs, so it should be judged here
            return false;
        dfs(0,dp,desiredTotal, maxChoosableInteger);
        return dp[0] == 1;
    }
    bool dfs(int state, vector<int>&dp, int desiredTotal ,int m){
        if(dp[state]!=0)
            return dp[state] == 1;

        for(int i = 0;i<m;i++){
            if((state&(1<<i)) ==0){
                if(i+1>=desiredTotal||!dfs((state|(1<<i)), dp, desiredTotal - i-1,m))   // i+1>=desiredTotal must be judged here
                {
                    dp[state] = 1;
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        dp[state] = 2;
        return false;
    }
};
