# Description
There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.


# Constraints
* 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
* -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
* nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
* -10^4 <= target <= 10^4


# Example
**Input**: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0


**Output**: true

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
Similar to [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](33.%20Search%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array.md) and [154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](../hard/154.%20Find%20Minimum%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array%20II.md). When l == mid and r == mid, we can not know which part is in order. Note that when l==mid and r!= mid, the left part is in order.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
         int n = nums.size();
        int l = 0,r = n-1;
        while(l<=r){
            int mid = (l+r)/2;
            if(nums[mid]==target)
                return true;
            // in this case we can not know which part is in order
            // if only one of the conditions satisfy, we can know which part is in order
            if(nums[l]==nums[mid]&&nums[r]==nums[mid]){
                l++;
                r--;
            }
            // if the left part is in order
            else if(nums[l]<=nums[mid]){
                // if targe is between nums[l] and nums[mid] we narrow the range to l-mid
                if(nums[l]<=target&&target<nums[mid])
                    r = mid-1;
                else
                    l = mid+1;
            }else{
            // otherwise the right part must be in order
                if(nums[mid]<target&&target<=nums[r])
                    l = mid+1;
                else
                    r = mid-1;
            }

        }
        return false;
    }
};
