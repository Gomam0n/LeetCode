# Description

There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.
# Constraints
* 1 <= n <= 100
* 0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
* flights[i].length == 3
* 0 <= fromi, toi < n
* fromi != toi
* 1 <= pricei <= 104
* There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
* 0 <= src, dst, k < n
* src != dst


# Example
**Input**: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1


**Output**: 200

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
This problem can be solved using BFS, DFS+memo and Bellman-Ford. Here we give an implementation of Bellman-Ford. One dimentional dp vector is not enough because we need to restrict the stop number.

# Key word
Shortest Path, BFS, DFS

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        vector<int>dis(n,INT_MAX/2);
        dis[src] = 0;
        for(int i =0;i<=k;i++){
            vector<int>newdis = dis;
            for(auto f:flights){
                if(dis[f[0]]+f[2]<newdis[f[1]])
                    newdis[f[1]] = dis[f[0]]+f[2];
            }
            dis = newdis;
        }
        if(dis[dst]==INT_MAX/2)
            return -1;
        return dis[dst];
    }
};

```
