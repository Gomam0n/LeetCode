# Description
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or reflected) to equal the other.

Return the number of distinct islands.

# Constraints
* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 50
* grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.


# Example
**Input**: grid = [[1,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,1,1]]


**Output**: 1

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
The tricky point is how to determine the same island(with the same shape). One way is to keep track of the relative coordinate. The other way is to keep track of the path. Why the same path will lead to the same shape?

# Key word
DFS/BFS

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string path = "";
    unordered_set<string>s;
    int numDistinctIslands(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n= grid[0].size();
        for(int i = 0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j = 0;j<n;j++){
                if(grid[i][j]==1){
                    dfs(grid,i,j,"0");
                    s.insert(path);
                    path = "";
                }
            }
        }
        return s.size();
    }
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, string code){
        if(i<0||i>=grid.size()||j<0||j>=grid[0].size()||grid[i][j]==0)
            return;
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        path+=code;
        dfs(grid, i+1,j,"1");
        dfs(grid,i-1,j,"2");
        dfs(grid,i,j+1,"3");
        dfs(grid,i,j-1,"4");
        path+="#";
    }
};
