# Description
A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:

* words.length == indices.length
* The reference string s ends with the '#' character.
* For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next '#' character is equal to words[i].  

Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words.


# Constraints
* 1 <= words.length <= 2000
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 7
* words[i] consists of only lowercase letters.


# Example
**Input**: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]


**Output**: 10

**Explanation**: A valid encoding would be s = "time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5].
words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"


# Solution
1. We can use Trie to do it. Reverse the string and store them into the trie. Use a variable to denote if this word is a suffix of other words.  
2. As the words and word length are small, we can enumerate all the suffix and delete the overlapping words.  
   
**Pay attention to the cases which contains the same words**

            if(curr->next[c-'a']==nullptr){
                curr->next[c-'a'] = new Trie;
                curr->count++;
            }
            curr = curr->next[c-'a'];
        }
        return curr;
    }

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLengthEncoding(vector<string>& words) {
        Trie * t = new Trie();
        unordered_map<string,Trie*>m;
        for(string s:words){
            reverse(s.begin(),s.end());
            Trie* curr = t->insert(s);
            m[s] = curr;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for(auto p:m){
            string s = p.first;
            if(m[s]->count==0)
                res+=s.size()+1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
