# Description
Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.



# Example
**Input**: time = "19:34"


**Output**: "19:39"

**Explanation**:The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.
It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.


# Solution
Two methods: one is to traverse from the current time until the time which is valid. The other is to enumerate all the possible time and determine which one is the closest.

**Pay attention to the case "00:00"**
