# Description
Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.



# Example
**Input**: time = "19:34"


**Output**: "19:39"

**Explanation**:The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.
It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.


# Solution
Two methods: one is to traverse from the current time until the time which is valid. The other is to enumerate all the possible time and determine which one is the closest.

**Pay attention to the case "00:00"**

        t = stoi(time.substr(0,2))*60+stoi(time.substr(3,2));
        for(char c:time){
            if(c!=':'){
                v.push_back(c-'0');
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0;i<256;i++){
            int j = i;
            int minute = v[j%4]+10*v[(j/4)%4];
            if(minute>=60)

                continue;
            int currT = hour*60+minute;
            if(currT<=t)
                currT+=1440;
            if(currT-t<dif&&currT-t!=0){
                dif = currT-t;
                string h,m;
                if(hour<10)

                    m = "0"+to_string(minute);
                else
