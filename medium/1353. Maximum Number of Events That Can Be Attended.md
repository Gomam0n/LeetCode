# Description
Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. Notice that you can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

# Constraints
* 1 <= events.length <= 105
* events[i].length == 2
* 1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 105


# Example
**Input**: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]


**Output**: 3

**Explanation**: You can attend all the three events.  
One way to attend them all is as shown.  
Attend the first event on day 1.  
Attend the second event on day 2.  
Attend the third event on day 3.  


# Solution
For these problems, we need to come up with a strategy before coding. The strategy for this problem is: for every meetings can be attended in one day, we should attend the first ending one. So we should record every meeting first and iteratively using a priority queue to determine which one is the first ending meeting in a day.

# Key word
Greedy

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        int maxDays = 0;
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> m;  // record the meetings in the map
        for(auto e: events){
            maxDays = max(maxDays, e[1]);
            m[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
        }
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>p;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i<=maxDays;i++){
            // push the meetings starting today
            for(auto end:m[i])
                p.push(end);
            // pop the meetings that ended 
            while(!p.empty()&&p.top()<i)
                p.pop();
            // decide which one to attend
            if(!p.empty()){
                res++;
                p.pop();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }   
};
