# Description
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

# Constraints
* 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
* s consists of only lowercase English letters.
* 1 <= k <= 10^4


# Example
**Input**: s = "abcdefg", k = 2


**Output**: "bacdfeg"

**Explanation**: /

# Solution
Simualte the process. Select 2k characters a time, if there is less than 2k, reverse the first k or all of them(less then k).

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        while(i<s.size()){
            if(i+k<=s.size()){
                reverse(s.begin()+i,s.begin()+i+k);
            }else{
                reverse(s.begin()+i,s.end());
            }
            i+=2*k;
        }
        return s;
    }
};
