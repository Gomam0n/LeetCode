# Description
Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Find the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.


# Constraints
* 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
* 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
* 1 <= k <= 1000
* arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length


# Example
**Input**: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5


**Output**: 9

**Explanation**: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.



# Solution
We keep track of how many positive numbers are missing as we scan the array.  
Also, as the array is sorted, whenever we find an element, we can know how many positive numbers are missing in [1:e], so we can do binary search. **Note that after the loop l is either the last element or the first element larger than the result, we should discuss the two cases.**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int last = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        int n = arr.size();
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            if(cnt+arr[i]-last-1>=k){
                return last+(k-cnt);
            }else{
                cnt+=arr[i]-last-1;
                last = arr[i];
            }
        }
        return arr[n-1]+(k-cnt);
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int l = 0, r = n-1;
        while(l<r){
            int mid = (l+r)/2;
            if(arr[mid]-mid-1<k)
                l = mid+1;
            else
                r= mid;
        }
        return (arr[l]-l-1)>=k?l+k:k+l+1;
    }
};
