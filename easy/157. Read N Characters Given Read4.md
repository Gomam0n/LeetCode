# Description
Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method to read n characters.

# Constraints
* 1 <= file.length <= 500
* file consist of English letters and digits.
* 1 <= n <= 1000


# Example
**Input**: file = "abc", n = 4


**Output**: 3

**Explanation**: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.  
Note that "abc" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.


# Solution
Keep read4 until: there is no character in the File or we have read enough characters

# Key word
Design

# Code

## cpp
```cpp
/**
 * The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
 *     int read4(char *buf4);
 */

class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of actual characters read
     */
    int read(char *buf, int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        // until read n character
        while(i<n){
            int ch = read4(buf+i);
            res+=min(ch,n-i);
            // no character in the file
            if(ch<4){
                break;
            }
            i+=4;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
